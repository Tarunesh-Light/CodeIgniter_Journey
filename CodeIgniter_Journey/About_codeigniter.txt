PHP 8.2: AllowDynamicProperties Attribute
#[AllowDynamicProperties] is a new attribute added in PHP 8.2, that avoids the deprecation notice on dynamic properties.
#[AllowDynamicProperties] property is declared in the global namespace. It does not accept any parameters.
When a class is declared with the #[AllowDynamicProperties] attribute, it no longer emits dynamic property deprecation
